# Contextualizing methods listed in this resources guide 
In this section, we offer recommendations of how to apply this resource guide during different phases of your forthcoming work on the CAMD suite. We've broken down future work for the CAMD team into three phases that relate to future work with a vendor:
- pre-award
- onboarding
- post-award 

## Pre-award
This phase begins at the start of fiscal year 2020, when 18F rolls off this project. What are the best ways for the CAMD team to continue on their own - with out 18F for coaching and without a vendor team to begin the work?

## Onboarding

We've talked about the benefits of working closely an collaboratively with your vendor rather than sending them of to work independently to execute on tasks. To develop a close an collaborative relationship, you need to set up how you want to work together. Some topics that you should definitely include are:

- What communication tools do we want to use together?

- Where are we managing our work? This should be a place where vendors and the CAMD can access

- What rituals/events will we hold together (sprint planning, sprint review, daily stand ups, etc)
- 
- Hold an initial kick off session to build a team charter or something like one. You want to establish what tools are best for communicating, where you're keeping documents, how long your sprints will be, the rituals that you'll participate in, etc.
- make sure that vendors have access to all the relevant systems and software 
- decide together on your definition
