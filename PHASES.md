# Contextualizing methods listed in this resources guide 
In this section, we offer recommendations of how to apply this resource guide during different phases of your forthcoming work on the CAMD suite. We've broken down future work for the CAMD team into three phases that relate to future work with a vendor:
- pre-award
- onboarding
- post-award 

## Pre-award
What should the CAMD product team work on after 18F rolls off this project and before a vendor is in place? There are a number of things that we suggest:

#### Developing buy in from relevant agency-wide stakeholders
As you prepare to adopt new ways of working (human centered design, Agile methods, DevOps, US Web Design System (USWDS), modular contracting), you'll need approval from offices outside of the CAMD. Now is a great time to start identifying who you need to bring into the fold. Many of these practices support agency-wide goals (for example, using the USWDS, will help the EPA comply with recently passed legislation requiring government websites to meet design and acessibility criteria). Can you position yourself as paving the path for the agency to follow?
- start by conducting stakeholder mapping to identify your key decision makers and stakeholders
- you know your agency best. Folks on the product team should work with CAMD leadership to develop strategies around how to do this best

#### Continue with journey maps and value proposition canvases
We have mapped out user processes in a number of ways - through use cases, user flows, and journey maps. Journey maps help us go deeper into the user's experience. We touched upon this practice but there's still more to do. 
- continue to develop journey maps for the existing CAMD suite personas that you've created
- use those journey maps to sketch out value proposition canvases; this process will help you think about what stories you want to put in your backlog.

#### Continue to build your backlog
We have been gathering user stories for a while now and we've talked about how these stories will help your vendors understand what user needs the CAMD suite should address.
- after developing journey maps and value proposition canvases, come together as a team for a story writing workshop
- gather these stories for your CAMD suite backlog. When you have vendors in place, this backlog will help you onboard them.

#### Inventory EPA sites that offer similar or related value to AMPD
- The EPA offers many public facing data resources that have overlap. Now is a great time to understand where these resources sit, what works well with them and what does not, where there is overlaps with AMPD and where there are distinctions. 
- Take inventory and use this when you begin identifying user stories for public data consumers.

#### Continue developing scrum experience
- Continue working together as a cross-functional and cross-branch product team. Continue to plan work in sprints and hold your rituals. Continue to communicate with eachother. You've begun developing your team - keep growing together. See how you might apply scrum practices to other areas of your work.
- If any of you can take trainings, such as the scrum master certification training, now is a great time to do so.  


## Onboarding

We've talked about the benefits of working closely an collaboratively with your vendor rather than sending them of to work independently to execute on tasks. To develop a close an collaborative relationship, you need to set up how you want to work together. 

#### Hold a kick off workshop to set up your relationship. Some topics that you should definitely include are:

  - What communication tools do you want to use together?
  - Where will you store work and artifacts? This should be a place where vendors and the CAMD can access
  - What rituals/events will you hold together (sprint planning, sprint review, daily stand ups, etc)?
  - Identify the systems/technologies will the vendors need access to
  - Go through documentation best practices deck
  - Set your **definition of done**, which will offer a common understanding of what needs to happen for a story to be complete. You can include criteria such as "code has been pair programmed or reviewed," "automated tests exist at all appropriae levels," "user documentation is updated," etc.).
  
#### Hold a backlog refinement workshop
  - during this session, you can discuss the user stories in your backlog with your vendors. They'll be able to give you feedback and you'll begin to incorporate their feedback into your work prioritization
  
#### Make sure vendors have access to everything that they need to begin working
  - This may sound basic, but it's not uncommon for vendors to wait a while before being able to get started becuase they can't get access to the necessary systems and tools. Be prepared to get them ready as soon as possible. 


## Post-award

### Maintaining a collaborative relationship
As you work with your vendor, you'll continue to be the experts in user and business needs - the elements that drive the vision of the product. Let your vendors be the experts on implementation, ie, how to achieve that vision. A few tips:
- instead of thinking of your vendors as staff augmentation that you have to manage, think of them as collaborators on your cross-functional team. 
- set a cadence of review for each sprint and give them heads down time to work in between sprint planning and sprint review.
- communicate often and early
- advocate for machine parsable code and plain language documentation

### Planning the work
Since you'll be working in smaller increments than are typical in waterfall projects, you won't have a detailed, multi-year plan to start. This means that you'll have to do more planning along the way. 
- set quartly planning sessions to write user stories and refine your backlog
