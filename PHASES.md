# Contextualizing methods listed in this resources guide 
In this section, we offer recommendations of how to apply this resource guide during different phases of your forthcoming work on the CAMD suite. We've broken down future work for the CAMD team into three phases that relate to future work with a vendor:
- pre-award
- onboarding
- post-award 

## Pre-award
What should the CAMD product team work on after 18F rolls off this project and before a vendor is in place? There are a number of things that we suggest:

#### Developing buy in from relevant agency-wide stakeholders
As you prepare to adopt new ways of working (human centered design, Agile methods, DevOps, US Web Design System (USWDS), modular contracting), you'll need approval from offices outside of the CAMD. Now is a great time to start identifying who you need to bring into the fold. Many of these practices support agency-wide goals (for example, using the USWDS, will help the EPA comply with recently passed legislation requiring government websites to meet design and acessibility criteria). Can you position yourself as paving the path for the agency to follow?
- start by conducting stakeholder mapping to identify your key decision makers and stakeholders
- you know your agency best. Folks on the product team should work with CAMD leadership to develop strategies around how to do this best

#### Continue with journey maps and value proposition canvases
We have mapped out user processes in a number of ways - through use cases, user flows, and journey maps. Journey maps help us go deeper into the user's experience. We touched upon this practice but there's still more to do. 
- continue to develop journey maps for the existing CAMD suite personas that you've created
- use those journey maps to sketch out value proposition canvases; this process will help you think about what stories you want to put in your backlog.

#### Continue to build your backlog
We have been gathering user stories for a while now and we've talked about how these stories will help your vendors understand what user needs the CAMD suite should address.
- after developing journey maps and value proposition canvases, come together as a team for a story writing workshop
- gather these stories for your CAMD suite backlog. When you have vendors in place, this backlog will help you onboard them.

#### Continue developing scrum experience
- If any of you can take trainings, such as the scrum master certification training, now is a great time to do so.  
- Continue working together as a cross-functional and cross-branch product team. Are there ways to apply practices from our mock project to the work that you do? Can you set a cadence in place of the entire CAMD product team continually collaborating together? Can you identify ways to continually improve lines of communications so that you continue to chip away at the natural siloes that form when you get caught in your day-to-day work? 

#### Inventory EPA sites that offer similar or related value to AMPD
- The EPA offers many public facing data resources that have overlap. Now is a great time to understand where these resources sit, what works well with them and what does not, where there is overlaps with AMPD and where there are distinctions. 
- Take inventory and use this when you begin identifying user stories for public data consumers.


## Onboarding

We've talked about the benefits of working closely an collaboratively with your vendor rather than sending them of to work independently to execute on tasks. To develop a close an collaborative relationship, you need to set up how you want to work together. Some topics that you should definitely include are:

- What communication tools do we want to use together?

- Where are we managing our work? This should be a place where vendors and the CAMD can access

- What rituals/events will we hold together (sprint planning, sprint review, daily stand ups, etc)
- 
- Hold an initial kick off session to build a team charter or something like one. You want to establish what tools are best for communicating, where you're keeping documents, how long your sprints will be, the rituals that you'll participate in, etc.
- make sure that vendors have access to all the relevant systems and software 
- decide together on your definition
