## Part 1: Methods
### Product Management
*Purpose* 
The goal of this section is to prepare the CAMD for managing the design and development of its products in collaboration with vendor teams. 

*How to use this section*
You’ll use the methods in this section to:
- Maintain a clear vision for the CAMD suite
- Identify the highest value work to pursue
- Maintain alignment across the CAMD product team
- Structure how you work together and continuously improve as a team
- Communicate product decision making with stakeholders who are outside of the CAMD product team
- Identify who to involve in the work and when to do so

#### People and Processes
- What’s the difference between project management and product management?
- Why do products fail?
- What are the characteristics of high performing teams?

#### Practice Makes Perfect
- Being Agile
- Agile values
- Scrum and Kanban
- Introducing the Mock Project

#### Ideation and Discovery: Product Market fit
- Product discovery
- Understanding your beneficiaries
- Discovery methods
- Mission Model Canvas

#### Value to your users
- Value proposition canvas

#### Working iteratively
- Draft your hypothesis
- Prioritize
- Working iteratively
- FedRAMP Dashboard, an example


#### Understanding Where to Begin: Story mapping
- What are story maps and when do we use them

#### Documentation best practices
- Documentation for code
- Documentation for user research (including handling and storing PII)
- Documentation tips, generally


### User Research
*Purpose*
The goal of this section is to introduce practices that will help the CAMD ensure that user needs drive the design and development of the CAMD suite.

*How to use this section* 
You’ll use the methods in this section to: 
- understand your users and what they need from the CAMDS 
- communicate user needs with your vendor team
- move away from breaking the CAMDS up by existing systems an instead break it up based on the functionality that users need from it
- test vendor work with users 

#### Conducting user Interviews 


#### Identifying use cases + user flows
- Our use case and user flow work in [MURAL](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1563828501832/297c861d5c108481f00d487705b30618df155b17)
#### Creating personas

#### Creating journey Maps

#### Usability testing 
- Cognitive walk throughs
- Usability testing
- User acceptance testing
#### Working Responsibly with Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Storing PII and determining access
- Creating codes for research participants
- Keeping notes clean of PII
- Ensure participants understand how their PII will be handled
- Make sure participants know who is in the room
- No PII in systems that are not approved to handle PII
- Get participant’s informed consent before proceeding

### Tech best practices

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” 

*Purpose*
The goal of this section is for a potential government tech lead in CAMD to be able to more confidently navigate the post-award management of a vendor-provided custom software development team, as they oversee a solicitation’s Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).

*How to use this section*
You’ll use the methods in this section to:
- Support transitioning to a DevOps environment
- Develop best practices in writing code
- Develop a test-driven development practice

#### DevOps
- What is DevOps?

#### Principles to good code:
- Consistency
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Quality of tests and testability
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)

#### Principles to good code review
- Have a checklist
- Train developers how to provide and accept honest feedback an criticism
- Provide a coding style guide
- [provide] training in writing proper tests
- Use the automated tools: linters, static analysis
- Avoid bike shedding
