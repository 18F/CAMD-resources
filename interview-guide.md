## General tips: 
- 45 minutes is generally a good amount of time for an interview
- Set your goal for the session and prepare your questions beforehand
- Pair up - have one person lead  and one person take notes 
- Keep track of time. Give five minutes at the end to wind down, ask the participant whether you’ve missed any important areas.
- If you are holding multiple interviews, using the same questions will make synthesis easier 
- Come together afterward,  debrief and discuss takeaways
- Send thank you afterward (ideally within a day)  

## Intro + setting Privacy expectations 
- Have you ever participated in a design research session like this? 
- There are no right or wrong answers to these questions, and you can’t offend us — we are simply looking to learn more about your professional experiences   
- Privacy: tell your participant how you’ll manage their PII, make sure this is ok with them (for more information about handling PII, [read this](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/Ethics%20and%20Privacy%20in%20User%20Research.pdf))
- Say whether you’ll be recording the conversation or not
- We will be taking notes today to keep as an internal reference for our team 
- We will not be publishing our notes publicly 
- If we want to get a direct quote and attribute it to you for any reason, we will come back to get your approval 
- Any questions? Ok, let’s get started!

- How often do you use [SYSTEM]? 
- What works well with [SYSTEM]? 
- What doesn’t work well with [SYSTEM]? 
- Can you give us an example of a time when you were unsure about [SYSTEM] functionality and how you came about resolving it? 
- If you had a magic wand and had an opportunity to change [SYSTEM], what would be the one thing you would change? 

## 5 minutes before end 
- Is there anything that you think we should know that we haven’t asked yet?
