## Part 1: Methods
### Product Management
**Purpose** 
The goal of this section is to prepare the CAMD for managing the design and development of its products in collaboration with vendor teams. 

**How to use this section**
You’ll use the methods in this section to:
- Maintain a clear vision for the CAMD suite
- Identify the highest value work to pursue
- Maintain alignment across the CAMD product team
- Structure how you work together and continuously improve as a team
- Communicate product decision making with stakeholders who are outside of the CAMD product team

#### [Documentation best practices](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/Documentation%20best%20practices.pdf)
- Documentation for code
- Documentation for user research (including handling and storing PII)
- Documentation tips, generally


### User Research
**Purpose**
The goal of this section is to introduce practices that will help the CAMD ensure that user needs drive the design and development of the CAMD suite.

**How to use this section** 
You’ll use the methods in this section to: 
- understand your users and what they need from the CAMDS 
- communicate user needs with your vendor team
- move away from breaking the CAMDS up by existing systems an instead break it up based on the functionality that users need from it
- test vendor work with users 

#### Conducting user Interviews 


#### [Identifying use cases + user flows](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/Use%20cases%20and%20user%20flows.pdf)
- Why we gather use cases and user flows
- How we gathered use cases
- Selecting a use case to focus on

Our use case and user flow work in [MURAL](https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1563828501832/297c861d5c108481f00d487705b30618df155b17)

#### [Creating personas](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/_Personas.pdf)
- What is a persona
- Why do we use personas
- Examples of persona pitfalls
- Keeping it simple


#### [Creating user flows and journey maps](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/User%20Flows%20and%20Journey%20Maps.pdf)
- the tl;dr
- user flows
- journey maps
- pairing a journey map with a value proposition canvas to identify product opportunities

#### [Testing with users](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/Testing%20with%20users.pdf) 
- Cognitive walk throughs
- Usability testing
- User acceptance testing
#### [Working Responsibly with Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/Ethics%20and%20Privacy%20in%20User%20Research.pdf)
- Storing PII and determining access
- Creating codes for research participants
- Keeping notes clean of PII
- Ensure participants understand how their PII will be handled
- Make sure participants know who is in the room
- No PII in systems that are not approved to handle PII
- Get participant’s informed consent before proceeding

### Tech best practices

*“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”*

**Purpose**
The goal of this section is for a potential government tech lead in CAMD to be able to more confidently navigate the post-award management of a vendor-provided custom software development team, as they oversee a solicitation’s Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).

**How to use this section**
You’ll use the methods in this section to:
- Support transitioning to a DevOps environment
- Develop best practices in writing code
- Develop a test-driven development practice
