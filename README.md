# CAMD Resource Guide
This resource guide exists to support the EPA's Clean Air Markets Divison (CAMD) team as it works with an Agile vendor to improve how the CAMD manages its emission data. 

Included are:
- [**Product, ux, and tech methods.**](https://github.com/18F/CAMD-resources/blob/master/METHODS.md) Primarily materials here are slide decks that 18F and the CAMD product team covered during its engagement together. We include relevant MURALs that we developed together as well. 

- **Contextualization of these methods.** After introducing these methods, 18F places these them in the context of the CAMD’s future relationship with its vendor: what do we recommend the CAMD do while waiting for its vendor? While onboarding its vendor? While working with its vendor post-award? 

- **A library of additional relevant resources.** These are additional resources to help the CAMD grow its capacity in human centered design, product management, agile methods, and DevOps.

While this guide includes technical jargon (journey maps, mission model canvas, etc.), mastering wording is not so important - for example, while we use the term “journey map,” others may use the term “experience map.” The underlying value of all of these methods is that they will enable clearer communication between different parts of a team and its stakeholders. We want you to rely on these resources to understand your relationship with your vendor as a collaboration - you should be able to follow them, and they should be able to follow you. To that end, all practices listed in this resource exists to support clear and collaborative communication:

- Between you and your vendor 
- Between CAMD and its users as well as stakeholders
- Across the MOB and EMB 
- Across the CAMD product team
